The Basic game is played by four players but in this game you can play this game with any number of players How ever the recommended
number is four You can even play this game with the computer but it will be too easy if you are a pro ; )
    
This game is played with a single card deck and what our objective is to collect cards in a single suit(Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts,
Spades) which give the total value of 31,

* And here are the values of the cards
    - A : Ace - 11
    - K : King - 10
    - Q : Queen - 10
    - J : Jack - 10
    - Other : Value of the card

* In this game we represent,
    - H : Heart
    - S : Spade
    - C : Club
    - D : Diamond

each player can keep 3 cards in there hands and they have three lives at the beginning all players them self three cards and the
what left in the deck is kept on the table and the top card is shown When each player playing their hand they they can either take
the card shown on the table or they can take the top card from the deck and replace a card with you, How ever you should keep only 
3 cards.

If a player is satisfied with the value of card they have they can 'Knock' when he does every other player get a chance to get a
card in either way mention above after all other players got their chance,
    1. The person who has the lowest value of cards in the same suit will lose a life
    2. If the person who had knock has the lowest card value he will lose **two lives**
    3. If two people have same lowest value then **both of them** will lose a life 

How ever if a player got 31 in his hand in same suit the round will be over instantly and player/players who got lowest values in
there hand will loose that round

every player can pass their hand without taking the card on the table or looking at the top card on the deck. But if a player see
the top card on the deck  he has to replace it or place it on the top of the discard cards on the table.
